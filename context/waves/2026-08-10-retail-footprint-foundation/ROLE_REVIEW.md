# Role Review: Retail Footprint Foundation Roadmap

These are AI-simulated review lenses, not real people or professional
endorsements.

## Scope

Reviewed the postal/address-first TURF roadmap after adding ZIP/postal
addressability as the foundational "original TURF" layer.

## Market Geographer

Status: pass with watch item.

The roadmap now treats postal geography as lived place infrastructure while
separating it from municipality, Census place, county, CBSA, urban area, and
retail market. The watch item is polygon language: future work must keep ZIP
Codes distinct from ZCTAs or other approximations.

## Retail Operator

Status: pass.

The roadmap now connects the learning path to practical company behavior:
planning, logistics, marketing, franchise coverage, and reporting. It should
lead to useful operator questions without requiring GIS expertise.

## Source Policy Auditor

Status: pass with required research gate.

The roadmap avoids redistributing restricted postal or locator data and makes
the "major companies use ZIP/ZCTA/postal-derived layers" claim a hypothesis to
validate by source, industry, and use case. Automated source fetching remains
blocked until source policy is documented.

## Catchment Modeler

Status: pass.

The roadmap keeps postal/address geography separate from distance, drive-time,
and gravity catchments. This is the right model order: first identify what a
place is called and where it is addressable, then ask which store or chain
serves it.

## Market Analyst

Status: pass with next-output request.

The roadmap should produce a ZIP/ZCTA business-use hypothesis register with
evidence status: observed, plausible, contradicted, or unknown. That gives an
analyst a practical path from intuition to sourced claims.

## Decision

Adopt the roadmap. The next pulse should research USPS/postal concepts,
Census/ZCTA definitions, and public examples of retail/logistics market
analysis using ZIP, ZCTA, or postal-derived layers before TURF automates any
postal or retail source acquisition.

## Pulse 06 Packet Review

### Market Geographer

Status: pass.

The Atlanta packet keeps Cumberland/Vinings and Buckhead as lived/market labels
without pretending those labels erase postal, municipal, or Census layers.

### Retail Operator

Status: pass with next-output request.

The packet finally reads as an operator artifact: city dominance, nearest-store
edges, and place warnings are visible together. Next packet work should add a
short narrative summary field for executives.

### Catchment Modeler

Status: pass.

The report labels catchments as straight-line nearest-store assignments and
does not imply travel time, franchise rights, or private territory ownership.

### Source Policy Auditor

Status: pass.

The packet uses repo fixtures and repeats the private-territory caution. Future
packets that ingest external chain locations still need explicit source-policy
approval.

### Report Contract Editor

Status: pass with watch item.

Markdown and JSON now expose the same packet sections. The watch item is schema
stability: future JSON changes should be additive where possible.

## Pulse 07 Narrative Review

### Retail Operator

Status: pass.

The packet now has a quick read before the tables: contested/dominant city read,
distance-weighted catchment leader, and place-context warning count.

### Source Policy Auditor

Status: pass.

The narrative is derived from existing fixture evidence and keeps the caution
language intact. It does not add unsupported claims about private territories.

### Report Contract Editor

Status: pass.

`narrative_summary` is an additive JSON field and the Markdown section preserves
the existing packet table order underneath it.
